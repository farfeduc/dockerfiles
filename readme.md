# Dockerfiles

This repository contains my Dockerfiles and my docker-compose.yml files to easy deploy docker apps.

More information on the official Docker-compose documentation : https://docs.docker.com/compose/


# Usage

To use my apps look for the readme.md inside each folder.

**Warning** : 
I prefer to use docker-compose to manage my apps. 
So if you want to use `docker run`, you can easily translate the docker-compose.yml files.
